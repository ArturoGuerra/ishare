## üì§ Custom Uploader Requests

With ishare, you can easily set up your own custom uploader. Here's a simple guide:

1. **Endpoint and Method**: When you use a custom uploader, ishare will send a `POST` request to the endpoint you provide.
  
2. **Configurations**: All the settings you've defined for your custom uploader will be included in this request.
  
3. **Adding Your Media**:
   - For screenshots: They'll be added to the request body as `multipart/form-data` under the `image` key.
   - For recordings: They'll be under the `video` key.

   (P.S. If you'd like, you can change these default key names)

## üõ† Custom Uploader Setup

If you're looking to integrate a custom endpoint for uploads using ishare, you're in the right place! By default, ishare supports and opens `.iscu` files for configuration. They are text files containing JSON data and you can make your own:

<details>
  <summary>
    üìù Specification
  </summary>
  
- **name** (string):\
  What would you like to call your custom uploader? This is its display name, making it easy to identify.
  
- **requestUrl** (string):\
  Where should ishare send the files? In the example, swap out `example.com/upload` with your specific upload URL.
  
- **headers** (optional, object):\
  Need to send any extra headers? Add them here as key-value pairs, with the key being the header name and the value being its associated data.
  
- **formData** (optional, object):\
  If you need extra form fields in the upload, specify them here. Similarly, use key-value pairs where the key is the form field name and the value is the field content.

- **fileFormName** (optional, string):\
  Want a different file name for the `multipart/form-data` request? Specify it here.
  
- **responseProp** (string):\
  Once the file is uploaded, where can we find its URL in the response? Swap out `"url"` for the specific JSON property path.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    üåü Example Configuration
  </summary>
  
```json
{
  "name": "ishare custom uploader",
  "requestUrl": "example.com/upload",
  "headers": { "Authorization": "Basic 0123456789" },
  "formData": { "key": "value" },
  "fileFormName": "image",
  "responseProp": "url"
}
```

Above is an example custom uploader for ishare. It sends uploads to `example.com/upload`, uses an authorization header, and includes additional form data. In the response, it expects to receive JSON with the property `"url"` containing the URL of your upload.

</details>

## Post Media Task Plugin Specification

Soon, ishare will allow you to script your own plugins that you can use as PMTs (Post Media Tasks).
